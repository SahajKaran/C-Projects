## Abstract Data Type Assignment

Your task for this assignment is to create two different classes that
implement the `Stack` ADT in [Stack.h](Stack.h). **Important**: don't change
[Stack.h](Stack.h) in any way!

1. Call one of your implementation classes `Vec_stack`, and implement it using
   a `vector<string>`. [adt_vec.cpp](adt_vec.cpp) gives a starting template.
   **Don't** `#include` any other files.
   
   Make sure `Vec_stack` has a *default constructor* that makes an empty
   stack.

   In the `main` function, add automated testing that tests *every* method in
   `Vec_stack`. Do enough testing to ensure that your implementation is
   correct.

   **Source code readability matters!** We want to see perfect indentation and
   use of whitespace, sensibly chosen names, good use of appropriate C++
   features, and so on. Please follow coding style used in the notes and
   lectures.

2. Call your other implementation `List_stack`, and implement it using a
   linked list that you create by hand. [adt_list.cpp](adt_list.cpp) gives a
   starting template. **Don't** `#include` any other files.

   `List_stack` should have a default constructor that makes an empty stack.

   In the `main` function, add automated testing that tests *every* method in
   `List_stack`. Do enough testing to ensure that your implementation is
   correct.

   features, and so on. Please follow coding style used in the notes and
   lectures.

3. Suppose you want to create a function that tests if two stacks are the same
   (i.e. have the elements in the same order) using a function with this
   header:

   ```cpp
   bool operator==(const Stack& a, const Stack& b)
   ```

   Is it possible to implement this `operator==` without changing the types of
   its parameters? If so, give an implementation of `operator==` that works
   correctly. If not, explain *exactly* how you would modify `Stack` to make
   this work efficiently.

   Write your answer for this question in a text file named
   [equality.txt](equality.txt). Spelling, grammar, and formatting matter!


### What to Submit

When you are done, compress [adt_vec.cpp](adt_vec.cpp),
[adt_list.cpp](adt_list.cpp), and [equality.txt](equality.txt) into a zip
archive named `adt.zip`. Include just those two files, and nothing else! Do
*not* put `Stack.h` in this zip file.

Submit `adt.zip` on Canvas when you're done.

Note that if your program does not compile with the course
[makefile](makefile), you will get 0 for the entire assignment.

Chatbot Description
===================
STUDENT NAME- SAHAJ KARAN

The Interesting thing about my Chatbot is that it can play a game of Would you rather with the user.

Apart from that it tells the user facts related to soccer and basketball it also has a lot of information about the highest paid soccer/basketball players. On running the chatbot if the user enters a greeting such as hello the bot recognizes the greeting and greets the user back if the input entered is not a greeting the bot prompts the user to maybe say hello to it. The chatbot has multiple greetings, facts and information about soccer / basketball players and a few game questions. After the user says hello the chatbot ask how the user is doing. Depending on how the user is feeling the chatbot gives differnt replies asking if the user would like to know a fun fact. If the user types yes the chatbot asks if the user wants a fact about soccer, basketball or even about the players in both the sports or if he would like to play a game depending on what the user enters ths chatbot tells a fact or initiates the game
based on what the user chooses.

If the user in case enters No the chatbot the user prompts other things that it can do. The chatbot recognizes keywords in the users input and gives a response based on that.All the responses have different variations and are stored in an array of the this is done so that every time the user runs the program the user gets a different experience with the chatbot as the responses are picked randomly.

If the user enters that he is sad. The chatbot replies with a motivational quote to cheer up the user.

Main features are as follows-
1.)If you type game it initiates a game of would you rather.
2.)Telling basketball facts.
3.)Telling soccer facts.
4.)Telling about highest paid players in basketball and in soccer.
5.)Tell a motivational quote if the user says he is sad.

You can play with the chatbot a game of Would You rather if you say game.
You can keep asking it more facts by saying yes when in the facts section about a particular topic
You can stop the chatbot from giving facts and it will tell what else it could tell you about.
It prints a goodbye message when you say bye to it and stops the program as well.
It tells you how it feels if you ask it how are you?
It also tells you what it can do if you ask him what can you do?
It also prints a special message if you react to its fact with a wow.
It also replies to Thank you's if you liked the quote or the fact.
